# Portfolio 1: Getting Started

I have been tasked by my lecturer Brian Davison to show that my current development environment is set up correctly, and that I have an understanding of the setup as well as  other potential configuration settings.

I will do this by making use of screenshots, as well as describing neccessary steps required. However, as this document is not intended for a layman, I will not be including every step. An example may include that I won't give instructions on how to download an application, but I will provide a link to that application. 

After, I will reflect on what I have discussed in this file. I will discuss any problems I have encountered, as well as the why the configuration included is appropriate for the task, any limitations the configuration has and finally alternative configuations that may be better in the future or with different circumstances.

## Setting Up

First, a brief overview of what was required in week 2. 

I had to download [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) and install it, then, after it was installed, I needed to clone a repository from [GitHub](https://github.com/). 

To install [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) click the blue text and go to the download section, the version I am using is **2022 Community Edition** which is free for students. During installation, when asked if I required additional packages, I chose no.

To create a [GitHub account](https://github.com/), click the blue text and register with GitHub. After, the user can then create a [repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/about-repositories). 

After I did these steps, I proceeded to clone the git repository that I created inside Visual Studio which can be seen below;

I was met with an authentication window and had to give approval. I then had access to the files held within the repository on Visual Studio.
